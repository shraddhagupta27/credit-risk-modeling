# Credit Risk Prediction Project

## Overview
This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline for credit-risk prediction. The goal is to identify borrowers at risk of default using structured financial data.

## Key Steps
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.  
- Feature Selection: Applied Chi-Square and ANOVA tests to retain statistically significant features.  
- Modeling: Implemented and compared Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance using Grid Search and cross-validation.  
- Model Evaluation: Assessed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score; validated on unseen test data for generalization.
